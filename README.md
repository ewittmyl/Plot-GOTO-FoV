### Plot-GOTO-FoV
This is the Jupyter notebook for plotting the GOTO FoV on top of the 
Gaussian skymap with a given location of the GRB reported positions, error
and the trigger number provided from GCN.
  Since this notebook is a complement of the ```goto-tile```, it is needed
to be cloned and the path is set before using this notebook.
