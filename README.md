### Plot-GOTO-FoV
This is the Jupyter notebook for plotting the GOTO FoV on top of the 
Gaussian skymap with a given location of the GRB reported positions, error
and the trigger number provided from GCN. The most updated ```Fermi_fov.txt```
should be put in the same directory with the notebook. Since this notebook is a complement of the ```goto-tile```, it is needed to be cloned and the path is set before using this notebook.


Require modules:\\
gototile
healpy
matplotlib
cartopy
numpy
pandas
